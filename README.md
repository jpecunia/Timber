Project Title: Timber

Description: Tree cutting game that requires you to dodge branches while working against the clock. Using the left and right arrow keys, chop the tree down continuously but watch out for the branches as the tree comes down. The red box on the bottom is your timer and it begin as soon as you press Enter. You gain a point for score and time back for every chop but the amount you get back decreases with every chop. Enter restarts the game and Esc exits the game. This game was not designed by me and was part of a lesson I paid for to help me learn C++ programing in a fun way.

Getting Started: I used Visual Studio 2017 with SFML 2.5.0 to create this. You will need all the files and folders under the Timber folder, including the dll files. The only files you don't need are Timber.vcxproj and Timber.vcxproj.filters.
